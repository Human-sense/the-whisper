The Whisper is designed as a perceptual augmentation—not a translation tool.

Its purpose is to preserve natural human conversation across language barriers by enhancing understanding and speech in real time, without phones, screens, or mandatory internet connectivity.

The long‑term goal is to make language feel intuitive through repeated, hands‑free interaction—so users gain confidence and cadence rather than dependency.
