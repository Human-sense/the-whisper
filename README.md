# The Whisper — A New Human Sense

**Founder: Ruel Ranoa**

## What This Is
The Whisper is a fully offline, in‑ear wearable that augments human conversation across language barriers. It listens to speech, whispers meaning in real time, and coaches pronunciation—allowing people to think, speak, and connect as themselves without phones, screens, or mandatory internet access.

## Why It Exists
Stopping a conversation to unlock a phone already breaks the moment.
If technology pauses human flow, it has failed.

The Whisper exists to keep human connection intact—in streets, transit, and service counters where internet access cannot be assumed.

## Core Principles
- Human voice remains central
- Offline by default; cloud is optional
- Sub‑second coaching loop
- Privacy‑first, on‑device processing
- Confidence over perfect grammar

## What This Is Not
- Not a device that speaks publicly for you
- Not a phone app
- Not cloud‑dependent translation

## Status
This repository currently documents vision, constraints, and direction.
Engineering and prototyping details will follow.
